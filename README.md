# Bingo-Card-Generator
Generate 'Bullshit Bingo' style cross off cards

Originally taken from (Jochen Kupperschmidt)[https://homework.nwsnet.de/releases/3822] site and reworked for python3, this code creates 'bingo' style cards that people can cross off words as they come up in a meeting or talk, and the first one to cross them all off can shout 'Bingo' and wins.

Created for an as-yet-future iRODS talk, so would need to be modified/parameterised to have custom headings.
